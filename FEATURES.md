list of stuff i want it to be capable offf

BIG ONE - view logs and have malware kill options on mobile. basically just everything can be managed from mobile through an app that communicates with an api (do i want this in golang? i dunno. maybe maybe not)

It'd be nice if i could have it use all different kinds of tech. Like the api will be for example a nodeJS based on maybe express then the uh the the the the the uhm the actual patrol and killer program will be golang cuz it's fast, then the mobile will be something i'm not entirely sure OJIOGJIOWEGIOWEIOGJIOWEG

mainly i want it to be mobile so i can be away from the computer for example and monitor it
