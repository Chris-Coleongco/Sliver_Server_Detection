# General

it seems sliver really likes 66 byte packet sizes

a lot of tcp keepalives

default port 8888


# Issuing C2 Commands

when issuing commands such as `ls`, `whoami`, the packet length increases to between 136 and 141 bytes

output from strace during command issuing results in write and read syscalls in strace
